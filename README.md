# coulter counter vs OD data

This dataset summarizes initial experiments looking at coulter counter cell/mL counts vs OD data from a spec20. Experiments 1 and 2 were P. denitrificans in chemostat culture grown at 25 and 37 degrees, respectively. Experiments 3 and 4 are batch culture experiments. 

We were also interested to see how fixing cells in 1% formaldehyde would impact the counts. Fixed cells were stored for six months. Fixed cell counts were only done for the chemostat experiments.

There are summary figs in the presentations folder and a knitted file of the analysis in the docs folder.
